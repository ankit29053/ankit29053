## Hi there !
I am Ankit, currently studying at IIT KGP in the Mechanical Engineering B.Tech 4 year course.
I am learning Blender and Ethical Hacking as of now.
Also I am an Astrophile. 
I have a great great zeal in learning about exospace, exolifeform, exoplanets where life is possible and teh greatest question of all time: "Are we alone?" ( I don't think so! )
Reach me at : gamesacc29053@gmail.com
