## Hi there !
<br>I am Ankit, currently studying at IIT KGP in the Mechanical Engineering B.Tech 4 year course.
<br>I am learning Blender and Ethical Hacking as of now.
<br>Also I am an Astrophile. 
<br>I have a great great zeal in learning about exospace, exolifeform, exoplanets where life is possible and teh greatest question of all time: "Are we alone?" ( I don't think so! )
